Sufficient fire distance can effectively reduce the influence of heat conduction and heat radiation, slow down the speed of heat convection, so as to delay the spread of fire. For example, a larger spacing reduces the amount of radiant heat absorbed by adjacent building surfaces, reducing the likelihood that their surface temperatures will reach the ignition point.\n\nDifferent types of buildings and structures and fire resistance ratings reflect their fire hazards and fire resistance capabilities. Buildings and structures with high fire risk (such as buildings with flammable and explosive materials) or buildings with low fire resistance ratings have higher combustion speed and heat release rate, so larger fire spacing is required to control fire risk. On the contrary, the fire risk is low or high fire resistance rating of the building structure, the allowable fire spacing can be relatively small.

Soil reinforcement: For example, cement mixing piles, lime piles, CFG piles, etc. are used for soil reinforcement to improve the shear strength of the soil and improve the physical and mechanical properties of the soil. Applicable conditions: the soil is soft, and the site allows pile foundation construction. Advantages: The reinforcement effect is remarkable, the application range is wide, and the slope stability can be significantly improved. Disadvantages: high construction cost, long construction period, may have an impact on the surrounding environment. Safety risk: slope instability may be caused during pile foundation construction.\n2. **Drainage measures:** For example, set up horizontal drainage holes, vertical drainage wells, etc., to reduce the groundwater level, reduce pore water pressure, improve the effective stress of the soil, thereby improving slope stability. Applicable conditions: the underground water level is high, and the drainage condition is good. Advantages: The construction is relatively simple, the cost is low, and the impact on the environment is small. Disadvantages: The effect may be limited by the amount of groundwater recharge and requires long-term maintenance. Safety risk: Improper drainage measures may lead to local instability of the slope.\n3. **Retaining wall support:** Build a retaining wall at the foot of the slope to provide support and improve slope stability. The commonly used retaining wall forms include gravity retaining wall, cantilever retaining wall, anchor retaining wall, etc. Applicable conditions: the slope height is moderate, the geological conditions allow, and there is enough space. Advantages: direct effect, good stability, wide application range. Disadvantages: The construction cost is high, the space is large, and it has a certain impact on the landscape. Safety risk: improper design and construction of the retaining wall may lead to overturning or slippage of the retaining wall, which may lead to slope instability.\n4. * * Slope protection: * * For example, measures such as grass planting, anchor spraying, net hanging and shotcrete are adopted to prevent slope weathering and soil erosion and improve the overall stability of the slope. Applicable conditions: low slope height, good soil, mainly used to prevent shallow slope damage. Advantages: simple construction, low cost, less impact on the environment. Disadvantages: limited reinforcement effect, mainly suitable for slope protection. Safety risk: slope protection measures may not be effective to prevent deep sliding.\n5. Anti-slide piles: Anti-slide piles are set in the slope to provide additional support and improve the stability of the slope through the bending and shear resistance of the pile body. Applicable conditions: there is a good bearing layer in the slope soil layer, which can provide sufficient pile end resistance. Advantages: The reinforcement effect is remarkable, which can effectively prevent deep sliding.

The mechanical parameters of the fault zone soil also need to be specially tested.\n2. **Seepage analysis:** Due to the high groundwater level, seepage analysis is required to determine the pore water pressure distribution in the soil. Finite element seepage software or simplified calculation methods (such as equivalent permeability coefficient method) can be used to solve the problem. In particular, the impact of extreme weather conditions, such as rainfall, on the water table needs to be considered.\n3. Slope stability analysis: Use appropriate slope stability analysis methods. Commonly used methods include limit equilibrium method (Bishop method, Janbu method, Morgenstern-Price method, etc.) and finite element method (strength reduction method).

Analyze the topography of the station area, and select the drainage mode of natural diffusion seepage drainage, rainwater open ditch, dark ditch (pipe) or mixed drainage according to the topography.

Long-term water absorption of the brick body may lead to a decrease in strength. Freezing and thawing cycles will cause micro-cracks in the brick body, which will reduce the overall stability of the brick structure under long-term action.\n2. **Geological factors:** The bearing capacity of silty clay is low, especially under the condition of high groundwater level, the soil pressure increases, which may exceed the bearing capacity of the brick structure. In addition, long-term immersion of groundwater will also accelerate the deterioration of the brick body.\n3. **Material factors:** The structure built with MU10 bricks and M2.5 mortar has relatively low compressive strength and shear strength, and it is difficult to resist long-term earth pressure and external loads.\n\nThe addition of concrete jacking and structural reinforcement can significantly improve the performance of brick cable trenches:\n\n* **Concrete compression roof:** Provides additional compressive strength, distributes the load and reduces the stress concentration of the brickwork structure.\n* **Structural reinforcement:** Improve the tensile strength of the structure and resist deformation and cracks caused by soil pressure, freezing and thawing, etc.\n\n**Concrete thickness and reinforcement area estimate:**\n\nDue to constraints, a simplified estimate is performed. Assuming that the soil pressure on the top of the trench is evenly distributed, the soil pressure is p = γ h = 18kn/m * 1.8m = 32.4 kpa (γ is the bulk density of the soil, taking 18kn/m; H is the buried depth of the cable trench, assuming a trench height of 1.5m above the ground of 0.3m = 1.8m).

The main challenge of foundation construction in permafrost areas is the uneven settlement of the foundation, which is mainly caused by the high thermal conductivity of the frozen soil, which leads to severe temperature fluctuations, which causes alternating frost heave and thaw settlement. Therefore, the solution measures focus on improving the thermal stability of the foundation, such as using high thermal conductivity materials to fill the foundation to accelerate the freeze-thaw process, and using a shallow foundation with a large area of the substrate to disperse the stress. ', 'B. Foundation construction in permafrost areas faces unique challenges, mainly reflected in the special properties of permafrost (low strength, high expansion, easy thawing), frost heave, thaw settlement and seasonal freezing and thawing. In response to these challenges, the following technical measures should be taken: select the foundation type with strong freeze-thaw resistance and strong settlement resistance (such as pile foundation and prefabricated foundation); carry out foundation treatment (such as artificial cooling and foundation reinforcement) to reduce the impact of frost heave; adopt construction technology suitable for permafrost conditions (such as anti-freezing measures in winter construction and anti-thawing measures in summer construction); as well as the foundation settlement, freeze-thaw monitoring. ', 'C. In view of the frost heave problem of permafrost, the effective solution is to adopt high-strength reinforced concrete foundation and increase the buried depth of the foundation to improve the freeze-thaw resistance of the foundation. At the same time, by setting the drainage system around the foundation, the groundwater level can be lowered and the occurrence of frost heaving can be reduced. In addition, during winter construction, heating measures can be used to speed up the melting rate of permafrost and shorten the construction period.', 'D. The key to foundation construction in permafrost areas is to control the temperature of the foundation to avoid frost heave and thaw settlement. For this reason, materials with high compressive strength and low water permeability, such as high-strength concrete, should be preferred, and a deep foundation should be used to bury the foundation below the permafrost layer, so as to isolate the influence of surface temperature changes. At the same time, the injection of cement slurry should be carried out after the frozen soil layer is completely thawed to ensure that the cement slurry is fully combined with the soil. ']",

Hot rods can be used to improve the stability of the foundation.\n2. **High altitude area:** The temperature in high altitude area is low, and the hot rod can help prevent the foundation from freezing and improve the safety of the tower foundation.\n3. **Areas with special geological structures:** For example, in areas with hidden landslides or soft soil foundations, hot rods can be used in conjunction with other foundation reinforcement measures to improve the stability of the foundation.\n\nThe technical points that need to be paid attention to when applying include: detailed geological survey, reasonable selection and arrangement of hot rods, and long-term monitoring of hot rod performance.

  "8a41573a20ea83e81f420beb27cda769": "The hot rod is usually made of a closed metal tube (e. g., a carbon seamless steel tube or a copper tube), which is filled with an appropriate amount of working medium (e. g., ammonia, acetone, water or Freon, etc.) after being vacuumed inside. The choice of working medium depends on the working temperature range and heat transfer performance requirements.\n\nIts working principle is based on the phase change heat transfer process of the working medium. When the lower end of the hot rod receives a heat source (such as geothermal heat), the working medium absorbs heat, vaporizes, and becomes a high-pressure gas. Due to the density difference, the gaseous medium will rise to the upper end (cold end) along the internal channel of the hot rod. At the upper end, the gaseous medium releases heat and condenses to a liquid state. The liquid medium relies on gravity to return to the lower end (hot end) through the internal channel, continue to absorb heat, and repeat the cycle, so as to achieve rapid heat transfer.\n\nThe reason why heat can usually only be transferred from the lower end to the upper end lies in the gravity-assisted backflow mechanism. The phase change process relies on endothermic vaporization at the lower end and exothermic condensation at the upper end. It is a natural process for gases to rise and liquids to fall. If the heat transfer is reversed, condensation occurs at the lower end, and the liquid needs to overcome gravity to rise to the upper end to evaporate. This requires additional energy input, is extremely inefficient, and is difficult to achieve in regular hot rod designs.",

By conducting shallow surface heat to deep underground, the hot rod reduces the temperature of the frozen soil and slows down the frost heave and thaw settlement, thus effectively preventing the foundation from freezing and thawing damage. The mechanism of action is to change the temperature field of frozen soil, reduce the amount of frost heave and thaw settlement, and enhance the stability of the foundation.\nApplication mode: burying hot rods around the foundation to form a heat exchange circuit.\n2. **Uneven settlement of foundation:** Frost heave and thaw settlement will cause uneven settlement of foundation, which will affect the inclination and stability of the line tower. The hot bar effectively controls the foundation settlement by slowing down the speed of frost heave and thaw settlement. The mechanism of action is to maintain the relative stability of the foundation soil temperature, thereby reducing the unevenness of frost heaving and thawing settlement.\nApplication mode: reasonable arrangement of hot rods, evenly reduce the temperature of the soil around the foundation.\n3. * * (Theoretically) Wire icing: * * Wire icing in cold areas will affect the safe operation of the line, which may lead to wire galloping, fracture and even tower collapse. The hot rod can theoretically increase the local temperature and reduce icing to a certain extent by conducting heat to the vicinity of the wire near the ground (such as the tower base). However, the actual effect is limited by the heat transfer capacity of the hot rod and the ambient temperature. The application of hot rods in this regard mainly plays a supporting role.\nApplication mode: a hot rod is arranged near the tower base to heat the surrounding air.\n\nThe main factors that may involve the application of hot rods in the Code for Construction and Acceptance of 110kV ~ 750kV Overhead Transmission Lines DL 50233-2014 include: geological survey data (such as geothermal gradient, frozen soil distribution), selection and arrangement of hot rods (considering heat transfer capacity, buried depth and spacing), and quality control during construction.",
